All programs are made using Python3, and as such, would require the computer to have python installed
To run the programs we require the Yahoo-finance api and the quandl api

1. pip install yahoo-finance
2. pip install Quandl

Example : 

python3 GatherDataQuandl.py
python3 GatheraMoreDataYahooFinance1.py

To import Data to database we load the SQL script in the Code folder.
